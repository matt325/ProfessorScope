# Professor Scope

## What is Professor Scope?
Professor Scope is a Google Chrome extension that will provide a seamless link between the MSU course selection page and RateMyProfessor reviews. To achieve this, the extension will automatically link the professor(s) on that course selection page with their corresponding review page on RateMyProfessor.

*At this point in time*, Professor Scope is made exclusively for MSU and will not work on the course pages of other universities.


## Pre-Alpha Concept
**Below is a visual of how the Pre-Alpha version of Professor Scope currently interacts with the course selection page on MSU's NEST**

Please note that information about courses, professors, etc. on the page have been changed for purposes of this example.

As you can see, this current implementation is **very straightforward** and will simply bold and link the professor's name *only if* a RateMyProfessor review page exists for them. Upon clicking the link, the corresponding review page will be opened in a new tab. 

This design will undergo various changes and re-works over the course of developement. For now, the goal is to have the extension function properly and run efficiently.
